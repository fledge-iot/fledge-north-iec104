Fledge North Plugin that acts as an IEC 104 server (slave)

This is a proof of concept IEC 104 server that can be run in the sending
process of Fledge to make Fledge appear as an IEC 104 server.

Building lib60870
-----------------

To build IEC104 C/C++ North plugin, you need to download lib60870 at: 
https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/mz-automation/lib60870.git
  $ cd lib60870
  $ export LIB_104=`pwd`

As shown above, you need a $LIB_104 env var set to the source tree of the 
library.

Then, you can build lib60870 with:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd lib60870-C
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  $ make install



Build
-----


To build the iec104 plugin, once you are in the plugin source tree you need to run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make

- By default the Fledge develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/fledge and /usr/lib/fledge
- If **FLEDGE_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FLEDGE_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FLEDGE_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override 
this default behaviour:

- **FLEDGE_SRC** sets the path of a Fledge source tree
- **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** sets the path to Fledge header files
- **FLEDGE_LIB sets** the path to Fledge libraries
- **FLEDGE_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
 - The **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the Fledge 
   header files have been installed in a single directory.
 - The **FLEDGE_LIB** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
   libraries have been installed in a single directory.
 - 'make install' target is defined only when **FLEDGE_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FLEDGE_ROOT set

  $ export FLEDGE_ROOT=/some_fledge_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FLEDGE_SRC

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_SRC=/home/source/develop/Fledge  ..

- set FLEDGE_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FLEDGE_LIB

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FLEDGE_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/Fledge ..

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/usr/local/fledge ..


Using the plugin
----------------

As described in the Fledge documentation, you can use the plugin by adding 
a service from a terminal, or from the web API.

1 - Add the service from a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

  $ curl -sX POST http://localhost:8081/fledge/scheduled/task -d '{"name": "iec104","plugin": "iec104","type": "north","schedule_type": 3,"schedule_day": 0,"schedule_time": 0,"schedule_repeat": 30,"schedule_enabled": true}' ; echo

Or

2) Add the service from the web GUI:

 - On the web GUI, go to the North tab
 - Click on "Add +"
 - Select iec104 and give it a name, then click on "Next"
 - Change the default settings to your settings, then click on "Next"
 - Let the "Enabled" option checked, then click on "Done"
